    <p>
        We want to have a place where kids can come together and hangout with each other while doing some good
        activities under adults supervision. A few activities we are currently conducting include practicing
        Srimad Bhagavadgita, learning about Ganesha, Hanuman and slokas.
    </p>
    <p>We would like to help in the personality development of our kids by teaching them good
        habits, values, social responsibility, self control, etc., We really appreciate all the help we can get
        from our community.</p>
    <p><a href="events.html?filter=kids">Some Recent activities can be seen here...</a></p>
    <p class="pb-3">If you would like your kids to participate in the weekly virtual sessions to learn
        Bhagavadgita verses (chanting and meanings), about Lord Hanuman and slokas, please contact us.</p>
